In simple words: You can check this code, study it and learn from it. You can even take pieces of code and include in your projects.
If your project is heavily based in my code and you want to use it for commercial purposes, this license does not allow you to do
that, but you can contact me for autorization no problem with that. (By the way I'm planning to change the license to free for comercial purpose but just not for now)
